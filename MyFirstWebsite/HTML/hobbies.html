    <p>I have a few hobbies, including drawing (<em>both digitally and traditionally,</em>)
    playing video games, and listening to music! I draw about<br> 70% of the time,
    and the other 30% is playing video games, all while listening to my <a href="tunes.html">favorite
    tunes</a>! I also loooove reading comics,<br> my favorite being the <em>Transformers:
    More Than Meets The Eye</em> series, as well as its currently-ongoing sequel,
    <em>Lost Light</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Below are some of my digital drawings. I'm very proud of these! Each
    took an hour or more to finish, the fastest one being the first, as it's just<br>
     a sketch. A fully colored, shaded, and lined piece like the one on the right
    usually takes me 3-5 hours. I draw on a Huion610 Pro tablet, and<br> use
    FireAlpaca as a drawing program.</p>

    <p>My favorite games to play are usually Nintendo games, as they're my
      favorite gaming company. I play on both my Switch and 3DS a lot, but I<br> also
      play on my PS4 if I feel like playing Overwatch. My favorite games are any
      Mega Man game, pretty much any Pokemon game (however<br> Ultra Moon and Ruby happen to be
      my favorite,) Sonic Mania and Sonic Adventure 2, Splatoon 2, and Animal Crossing:
      New Leaf, to name<br> a few.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I love to read comics. Generally I hate reading, but having
    incredible art to look at as you read is a real<br> treat. I, in particular,
    love the Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye and Lost Light series. I've
    reread it multiple<br> times now, and issues are still coming out!!</p>
